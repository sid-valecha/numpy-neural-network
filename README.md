# Neural Network from Scratch
- Fully connected feedforward neural network from scratch using only NumPy, without relying on deep learning libraries.
- Trained the model on the MNIST dataset, optimizing weight updates using backpropagation and gradient descent.
- Implemented activation functions, loss functions, and optimization techniques to improve network accuracy.
- Miniâ€‘batch SGD with optional momentum
